# lets write a simple python code to print a few statements
# Assumption: you already have the local environment setup for python

# the obvious
print('Hello World!')

print('Hello Again')
print('I like typing this.')
print('This is fun !!')
print('Yay! Its printing !!')

# Cool stuff, right!
# This is jist for someone who has to start from scratch and wanted to straightaway 
# get into writing code rather than going through tons of books and material

# thanks for watching!
